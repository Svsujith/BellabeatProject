# About the Company
Bellabeat is a health tech company that specializes in creating wearable technology for women. Their products focus on providing holistic insights and tracking for women's health and wellness, including activity tracking, stress management, and menstrual cycle tracking. Bellabeat aims to empower women to take control of their health by providing personalized data and insights.

# Business Task
* Utilizing the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, identify some trends in smart device usage, how these trends can be applied to Bellabeat’s customers and how they can help influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# Recommendations

### App Notifications
* To ensure users are wearing their FitBits consistently, Bellabeat should consider sending a daily notification reminding them to charge their wearable device at the end of the day.
* More than half of the users are not reaching the recommended 10,000 steps per day. Bellabeat should send notifications throughout the day to remind users to "get up & move" or "complete their step goal for the day" to increase their overall step count.
* The data showed that users typically take the most steps during lunch hours or between 5 pm to 7 pm. Bellabeat should utilize this information to send personalized app notifications to recommend users start their walk or workout if they haven't begun their exercise routine at their usual time of increased steps. Moreover, they can promote workout routines, plans or classes tailored to these times of the day.
* Lastly, users who averaged five hours of sleep or more had a higher average step total. Bellabeat can help users increase their sleep time by sending a notification to "wind down for sleep" at a specific time based on their sleep habits, potentially helping them achieve better health outcomes.

### Marketing
* The high level of activity among users, with 93.5% of them being consistent in utilizing their FitBits, suggests that Bellabeat should focus its marketing efforts on customers who are already invested in wellness and using fitness trackers. Highlighting the unique features of Bellabeat's products, especially those designed for women, may entice these customers to switch to Bellabeat's products for more targeted insights.
* Since users tend to be most active during lunchtime and in the late afternoon to early evening, Bellabeat should target customers who have set schedules, such as those with regular jobs or parents with a predictable daily routine. By focusing on these customer groups, Bellabeat can tailor its products and marketing messages to fit their needs and increase the likelihood of adoption and continued use of its products.
